# Visual Attention for Event Cameras based on Spiking Neural Networks

This work consists in the adaptation of the Matlab code produced by Bernert and Yvert (2019) to the DVS128 Gesture dataset. 
The data is imported from the Python library `tonic` and translated in a CSV file comprehensible by the Matlab code thanks to the script `transform_DVS_Gesture.py`.

## How to run the script ? 

  
## Requirements
  
`Matlab` should be installed under the version 2018b at least. 
The script `transform_DVS_Gesture.py` requires the following Python libraries : 
- numpy
- csv
- tonic

## Preliminary results
SOme preliminary results can be found in the **Results** directory. The format `.fig` can be opened using Matlab.
